# MGCA Non-functional Requirements Acceptance Pack

Free supporting resources | MGCA-NF-001 | Published by MGCA Ltd

Turn “fast enough” and “reliable enough” into reviewable criteria.

## Start with the product you purchased

Unzip your purchased pack and open START_HERE.pdf or START_HERE.docx. This public folder supplements the pack with free guidance and small format-checking examples. It does not contain the paid workbook, detailed guide, assessment materials, product automation or release ZIP.

## First checks

1. Express a quality requirement with its unit, test condition and evidence source.
2. Keep an untested criterion distinct from a failed criterion.
3. Retain the environment and workload assumptions used for a measured result.

## Free resources in this folder

- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md): checks to make before raising a file issue.
- [Official references](references.md): links to authoritative background documentation.
- [Synthetic CSV](support-example.csv) and [synthetic JSON](support-example.json): tiny examples for the shared file-inspection helper. They are not inputs for the paid product tools.
- [Free helper instructions](../../tools/README.md): inspect CSV/JSON structure or verify a purchased file manifest.

## Try the free example

From the root of this resources repository, with Python 3.10 or later:

```text
python tools/inspect_file.py products/dafol-non-functional-requirements-acceptance-pack/support-example.csv --required item --required status
python tools/inspect_file.py products/dafol-non-functional-requirements-acceptance-pack/support-example.json
```

The helper reports file structure only. It does not score readiness, decide acceptance, compare architecture options or replace the purchased product.
