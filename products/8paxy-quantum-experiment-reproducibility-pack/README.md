# Quantum Experiment Reproducibility Pack

Free supporting resources | QCE-ER-001 | Published by MGCA Ltd

Keep a quantum simulation’s inputs and results reproducible.

## Start with the product you purchased

Unzip your purchased pack and open START_HERE.pdf or START_HERE.docx. This public folder supplements the pack with free guidance and small format-checking examples. It does not contain the paid workbook, detailed guide, assessment materials, product automation or release ZIP.

## First checks

1. Retain the seed, shot count and source version for a reproducible run.
2. Distinguish local simulation from execution on a quantum processor.
3. A matched output distribution alone does not establish quantum advantage.

## Free resources in this folder

- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md): checks to make before raising a file issue.
- [Official references](references.md): links to authoritative background documentation.
- [Synthetic CSV](support-example.csv) and [synthetic JSON](support-example.json): tiny examples for the shared file-inspection helper. They are not inputs for the paid product tools.
- [Free helper instructions](../../tools/README.md): inspect CSV/JSON structure or verify a purchased file manifest.

## Try the free example

From the root of this resources repository, with Python 3.10 or later:

```text
python tools/inspect_file.py products/8paxy-quantum-experiment-reproducibility-pack/support-example.csv --required item --required status
python tools/inspect_file.py products/8paxy-quantum-experiment-reproducibility-pack/support-example.json
```

The helper reports file structure only. It does not score readiness, decide acceptance, compare architecture options or replace the purchased product.
